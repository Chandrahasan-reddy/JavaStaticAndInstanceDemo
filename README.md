# JavaStaticAndInstanceDemo
A simple Java project that demonstrates the execution order of static blocks, static methods, instance blocks, constructors, and instance methods in a class. Useful for Java beginners to understand class loading and object instantiation behavior.


# JavaStaticAndInstanceDemo

This Java project illustrates the concept and execution order of:

- Static blocks
- Static methods
- Instance initialization blocks
- Constructors
- Instance methods

## üîç What It Demonstrates

This code shows how Java handles class-level and object-level initialization using static and instance blocks. It prints the execution order of each block/method when the class is loaded and an object is instantiated.

----------- OUTPUT ------------
Inside static block.
Inside static method.
Inside instance block.
Inside constructor.
Inside instance method.
